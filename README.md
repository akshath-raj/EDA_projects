# Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial initial step in data science projects. It involves analyzing and visualizing data to understand its key characteristics, uncovering patterns, and identifying relationships between variables. It refers to studying and exploring record sets to apprehend their predominant traits, discover patterns, locate outliers, and identify relationships between variables.
  
In this repo, I shall be doing EDA on various datasets (from Kaggle) ranging from small and simple to large and complex datasets. Each directory in this repo will refer to a single EDA dataset. Every directory will have three main components:  
* README.md that will list all the inferences for that particular dataset.  
* Python code for the EDA.
* The dataset used for analysis in .csv format.
